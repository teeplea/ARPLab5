# Scoping NRM

We learned about the linear/nonlinear reactivity model.  Basically, we 
can approximate an N-batch PWR using just the output from a code like
CASMO.  Here, that allows us pretty readily to explore what sort of 
enrichment we might expect to require for an 18 GWd/t cycle length.  We can
also do the same for the 12 GWd/t cycle and get a sense for how far off
NRM is and then correct for it by adjusting bulk enrichments one way or
another.  My hope is that this provides sufficient information to nail
a working SIMULATE model (w/r to cycle length) in very few tries.
